                <p>
                    The idea of Tandem Legends began as Breath of the Wild ended. Left with more questions than answers, Joe innundated Shannon with hazy recollection and half-remembered canon of previous games. Together they decided to embark on a journey exploring the Zelda timeline and see what truths were hidden among it's nearly two dozen games.

                <h2>Shannon</h2>
                <p>
                    Shannon is new(ish) to playing the Legend of Zelda series but having grown up with plenty of older brothers she started Tandem Legends with more than a casual understanding of the series. Her first completed Zelda game was Skyward Sword. Outside of the Legend of Zelda series Shannon enjoys the Dragon Age trilogy, Final Fantasy, For The King, Civilization, Animal Crossing, and Divinity Orginal Sin.

                <h2>Joe</h2>
                <p>
                    Joe's been playing Zelda games since before he really "got" games. But didn't come into their own as a Legend of Zelda afficianado until Ocarina of Time captured their imagination, inspiring many (if uneventful) quests into the woods behind their house. Outside of the Legend of Zelda series Joe enjoys the Mass Effect trilogy, Dragon Age, Fable, Civilization, Minecraft, Animal Crossing, and the Halo series.
